    <p>In the example of a global variable on p61, {c = 5; c;}, <span>why does the code not throw an error for the variable being undeclared?</span></p>
    <p>p82 - typeof NaN = number (haha!) <span>Why can't you test to see if a value is a number by comparing to NaN? </span>(42 !== NaN) is true, so 42 is a number. Instead you use Number.isFinite().</p>
    <p>p87 - I was aware of parseInt, but did not know it would also convert the number base.</p>
<p>p88 -<ul><li><b>Undefined</b> = coerced to NaN and usually set by js</li>
<li><b>Null</b> = coerced to zero and usually set by the programmer</li></ul></p>
<p>Bitwise operators - Some of the number manipulation almost seems like magic, but I can't see <span>where the practical application comes in?</span> They can reduce the time to do calculations, and are used in lower level programming.</p>
<p><ul><li>Soft equality (==) - does not take type into account when comparing values and may force values</li><li>Hard equality (===) - will look at type when comparing values. Except NaN === NaN evaluates as false. So you have to use Number.isNaN(NaN) to get 'true'. This answers my question above from p82. :) Always use === while keeping in mind the NaN anomaly and explicitly convert types before comparing.</li><li>Inequality - similarly there is soft inequality (!=) and hard inequality (!==). The former suffers from type coercion, the latter is the preferred method.</li></ul>

   <p>Chapter 3 reading. I had to try <em>typeof []</em> because I would have expected to be testing <em>typeof myArray;</em> instead. It did produce the result 'object' but that made me wonder <span>how to delete an array?</span> I read on p128 that you can assign 'null' to an array to delete it, but when I tried that on the array I created, I got <span>Uncaught TypeError: Assignment to constant variable? So maybe the question is, how do you delete a const?</span> Apparently you will have to start a new session because a const, by definition, is unchangeable.</p>
   <p><span>When you use the concat method without using assignment, how do you refer to the new, combined array?</span></p>
   <p>p128 - <em>array = [...strong][0];</em><span>What is the <em>[0]</em> for?</span></p>
   <p>p153 - <span>what is the purpose of an anonymous function?</span> It looks like they are meant for non-complex functions that will not need to be reused elsewhere.</p>
