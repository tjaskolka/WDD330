<h1><a href="story_editor.html">Story Writer</a></h1>
    <p>I did not copy the code from the book exactly because I wanted it to reflect what I have been learning and it did seem to be a little outdated in some respects. This meant that I did encounter a few errors as I redid the code. My saveStory worked fine from the beginning and it was interesting to pull up the local storage information in the Developer Tools and see that even after closing the browser and coming back, that information persisted (as it should).
        I am wondering if local storage is something I can use to create a timecard app for work? </p>
        <h1><a href="even_or_odd.html">Even or Odd</a></h1>
        <p>This exercise was mostly review, but a good chance to go over nested ifs. I wanted to add my own check to see if an integer or decimal number was submitted and respond appropriately to that. It took a few tries before I was able to put that in the correct order so that it would respond for a non-integer only when it was a non-integer.</p>
    <h1><a href="introduction-to-RWD-lesson2.2/01.html">RWD Media queries</a></h1>
    <p>This was interesting seeing the progressive changes as the css changed.</p>
    <h1><a href="introduction-to-RWD-lesson2.2/02.html">RWD Media queries pt. 2</a></h1>
    <p>I liked seeing how the text can change size with the size of the viewport. I hadn't looked too closely at that before.</p>
    <h1><a href="introduction-to-RWD-lesson3.1/01.html">Fluid inline images</a></h1>
    <p>I have had some troubles with getting images to be responsive, so this was a useful review and I learned about getting rid of the bottom white line using 'vertical-align: middle'</p>
    <h1><a href="introduction-to-RWD-lesson3.2/02.html">Fluid background images</a></h1>
    <p>Again, I followed the exercise to learn more about using background images. I also learned about using 'padding-bottom' to keep the image in proportion as it resized. Why couldn't I find this information before?</p>
<h1>Master Mobile UX</h1>
<p>How do you turn on autofill? Or create those floating labels? I like the credit card field that scrolls and prompts as you enter data. Seems like that could be applied in other areas as well. How do you automatically space the credit card number as the user enters it? NO POP-UPS or POP-OVERS! Zuckerman's apology, lol.</p>
