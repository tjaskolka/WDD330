    <h1>Week 14 Code & Notes</h1>
     <h2><a href="project/">Timeclock</h2>
     <p>My goal was to create a timeclock that could be used by some of the employees where I work. Many of the employees work part-time and so can easily work another part-time shift. Weirdly enough, when they do that, they are unable to clock in for the additional shift, but have to write their time down on a piece of paper and submit it. So I hoped to be able to create something that could be used for this particular situation. I chose local storage because security requirements would prevent me from having access beyond the one computer. Having everyone have to log in and out of one particular computer wouldn't be much more inconvenient than writing their times on that piece of paper.</p>
