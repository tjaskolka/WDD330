    <p>Even though my time is limited, I felt I needed more practice with javascript. About halfway through the course, I began to feel that I was out of my depth, but that with enough study, I could pull it off (because I thought I would have the time). I have studied and practiced a lot, but want to add to what I have already done so I can feel like I 'own' it. Right now, I have a lot more know-how in my head and I need to work on applying what I know. Once I can do that, I WILL own it. :)</p>
