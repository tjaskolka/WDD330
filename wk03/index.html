    <h1>Week 3 Notes and Code</h1>
    <h2>Object Methods reading</h2>
    <p>Object = representation of a real world entitity (ex. user John)</p>
    <p>Method = function that is a property of a method, allows objects to "act"</p>
    <p>OOP = code using objects to represent entitites</p>
    <p>this = used by method to access object (before the dot)</p>
    <p>Arrow functions do not have a "this" but instead reference the outer function</p>
    <pre>  let calculator = {
        read() {
          this.num1 = +prompt('1st number?');
          this.num2 = +prompt('2nd number?');
        },
    
        sum() {
          return this.num1 + this.num2;
        },
    
        mul() {
          return this.num1 * this.num2;
        }
    
      }
    
      calculator.read();
    alert( calculator.num1 + ' + ' + calculator.num2 + ' = ' + calculator.sum() );
    alert( calculator.num1 + ' * ' + calculator.num2 + ' = ' + calculator.mul() );</pre>
    <h2>JS Ninja reading</h2>
    <h3>Chapter 5: Objects</h3>
    <p>Object literal = object that is created by wrapping its properties & methods in curly braces</p>
    <p>Calling a method is the same as invoking a function, (use () after method name).</p>
    <p>Object literal pattern = create an object literal that serves as a namespace, then add values as properties of that object and functions as methods.</p>
    <h3>Built-in Objects</h3>
    <ul><li>Arrays</li>
    <li>Functions</li>
    <li>JSON</li>
    <li>Math</li>
    <li>Date</li>
    <li>RegExp</li></ul>
    <h2>You Don't Know JS Reading</h2>
    <p>Statements = a group of words, numbers and operators that performs a specific task. e.g. <pre>a = b * 2</pre></p>
    <p>Expressions = components of a statement. Using above example:
        <ul><li>'2' is a <em>literal value expression</em></li>
        <li>'b' is a <em>variable expression</em></li>
    <li>'b * 2' is an <em>arithmetic expression</em></li>
<li>'a = b * 2' is an <em>assignment expression</em></li></ul>
Other expressions:
<ul><li>Expression statement - 'b * 2'</li>
<li>Call expression - 'alert(a);'</li></ul>
    </p>
<p>Interpreting code = translation of code to computer language done at runtime.</p>
<p>Compiling code = translation of code to computer language done prior to runtime.</p>
<p>Javascript code is compiled then run at runtime.</p>

<p>I was the 'driver' this week. Again, I found it hard to concentrate on creating code 'in public' as well as to not be distracted by just listening to others and typing for them. I think I just need more practice coding. I have signed up for Javascript30 and will be working on that a little bit every day, if possible, to get practice.</p>
