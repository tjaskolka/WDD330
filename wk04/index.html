<h2>Team Activity</h2>
<p>Tic-tac-toe game. We built an interactive game that used an event listener to mark the board with Xs or Os. Since it was easier to do online together, we used the 'click' event while building the game. Afterwards, we changed the event to 'touchend' per our instructions and it still worked. :) See both versions here:</p>

<h2>Chapter 12 - Object Oriented Programming</h2>

<p>OOP has 3 main concepts:</p>
<ol><li>Encapsulation - inner workings are hidden and only essential functions are available</li>
<li>Polymorphism - various objects can use the same method</li>
<li>Inheritance - take features of one object and add new ones</li></ol>
<p><em>Prototype-based</em> = used by javascript before classes became available.</p>
