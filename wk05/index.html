    <h1>Week 5 Notes and Code</h1>
    <p>Errors are usually caused by one of the following:</p>
    <ul><li>System error</li>
    <li>Programmer error</li>
<li>User error</li></ul>
<p>It is the programmers responsibility to be aware of possible system errors and work around them, to fix errors in programming ASAP and to anticipate possible user errors and provide ways to deal with them that will help the user.</p>
<p>EXCEPTION: error that produces a return value that can be used by the program to deal with error.</p>
<p>STACK TRACES: sequence of functions or method calls that lead to the point where the error occurred.</p>
<p>WARNINGS: an error that isn't enough of a problem to stop the program from functioning.</p>
<p>STRICT MODE: a less forgiving way of running the program that will catch and identify more exceptions and warnings and especially sloppy code practices. To use strict mode, just add the following as the first line of the javascript file: 'use strict';. Strict mode can also be used inside a function to limit it to that function. It is recommended that you place all your code in a function that will invoke strict mode:</p>
<pre>
    (function() {
        'use strict';
        //All your code would go inside this function
    }());
</pre>
<p>Javascript modules are strict by default and do not require the 'use strict' declaration.</p>
<p>Linting tools - used to catch syntax errors and can enforce proper style and conventions.</p>
<p>It is recommended to check for browser support of desired features before calling the method, preventing exceptions that might cause issues. (see Modernizr or Can I Use?)</p>
<p>Use alert() when debugging to check expected value(s) at certain point, as well as stop the process at that point (until you click 'OK').</p>
<p>Use console.trace() to show chain of functions called up to that point.</p>
<p>Use debugger command within code to pause execution and check variables.</p>
<p>Errors:</p>
<ul><li>EvalError - no longer used</li>
<li>RangeError - number is outside allowable range</li>
<li>ReferenceError - reference to item that doesn't exist</li>
<li>SyntaxError - problem with code syntax</li>
<li>TypeError - unexpected type of value being used</li>
<li>URIError - problem with the URI</li>
<li>InternalError - error with Javascript engine (e.g. recursion)</li>
</ul>
<p>Error properties (to be used for custom errors):</p>
<ul><li>name - returns name of (custom error) function</li>
<li>message - description of error</li>
<li>stack - stack trace of error (not for production use)</li></ul>
<p>Use 'throw' to create your own exceptions (not covered by that above)</p>
<p>try - used to wrap a suspect piece of code that will pass the error to a 'catch' block, where you can diagnose and deal with the error.</p>
<p>finally - code that will run after try and catch regardless of which ran before.</p>
<p>TDD - Test Driven Development - writing tests before you write the code. Then write code to pass the tests, then streamline the code while testing all along. Full process:</p>
<ol><li>Write tests</li>
<li>Write code to pass tests</li>
<li>Refactor the code</li>
<li>Test refactored code</li>
<li>Write more tests for new features</li></ol>
<p>Expectation object - returned by test function</p>
<p>matcher - information provided to test to check function output (if function works correctly, they should match)</p>
